    <p>Nicki Minaj married Kenneth "Zoo" Petty in October of 2019. On September 30th, 2020, they had a child together, who Nicki calls "Papa Bear." Nicki has dreamed of starting a family and having children, and has always wanted a baby boy because she's attached to her little brother and felt like he was her real son. She always wanted her child to feel loved and have her utmost attention, so when thinking of hypothetically having a child, she said she'd "take a little break." This actually ended up happening when Minaj became pregnant, and everyone thought that she was retiring from the rap game at the age of 33. However, after some time, she got back into the game and re-released her <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/2upw5IrzeqKApIQZyx5o6r?si=oy1pN2YJRf20c8qdgXTEag&dl_branch=1" target="_blank">"Beam Me Up Scotty" mixtape with new songs</a> such as <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/28PeqNMnFfVQnXvXmyf88G?si=af04af12076b4673" target="_blank">"Fractions,"</a> <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/1TZv3bujNaYz646eezRE91?si=a221ab9b4abd4d8b" target="_blank">"Seeing Green"</a> (which actually mentions Papa Bear) and <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/2nxy7TbWDWOBm2bseZJX2A?si=84cac99459544cb5" target="_blank">"Crocodile Teeth (Remix)."</a></p>

    <p>Nicki wanted to be married and have a baby plus $500 million by her fifth album, and possibly another baby by that time as well. It is very impressive that she was able to achieve this before her fifth album, and it seems that with Nicki's ambition to have a secind child by her fifth album, she is on her way to starting a big, loving family of her own.</p>
