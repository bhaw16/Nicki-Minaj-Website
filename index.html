      <li>The cover art depicts one of Nicki Minaj's alter egos, Nicki the Harujuku Barbie (often referred to as Barbie). Barbie is one of Nicki's most famous alter egos alongside Roman Zolanski (The two alter egos were arguing in Nicki's feature on Kanye West's song <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/1ZHYJ2Wwgxes4m8Ba88PeK?si=bc46f3cc22904c62" target="_blank">Monster</a>). Roman is also on the song "Roman's Revenge," which is one of the songs from the <span class="pink-friday">Pink</span> Friday album. There are two versions: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/1PE8Lkg4HY530KORtjsCs7?si=e8294a2de1f24a49" target="_blank">one with a feature from Eminem</a> and <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/65mvvdnbRTadGb9AoIjD3g?si=a875b495bd8e4913" target="_blank">one with a feature from Lil Wayne</a>.

    <h2>The <span class="pink-friday">Pink</span>print</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>The <span class="pink-friday">Pink</span>print is Nicki's 3rd studio album which was released on December 15<sup>th</sup>, 2014. The most popular song from the album is <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/7zycSpvjDcqh6YT1FEl2kY?si=2a027c4bf8254949" target="_blank">"Anaconda,"</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/LDZX4ooRsWs" target="_blank">the music video for that song</a> has about a billion views. This song showcases the fierce and confident Nicki that everyone knows, which some people criticize her for and think that she is overrated and untalented. However, many of the sings oin the <span class="pink-friday">Pink</span>print shows a sentimental side of Nicki, where she sings and raps about emotional experiences. </li>
      <li>Songs like <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/23wvTLW9dV16Yt7XoF8LkP?si=c9013a9eb62443a0" target="_blank">"Grand Piano"</a> (one of my favorite Nicki songs of all time and one of the most emotional songs from the <span class="pink-friday">Pink</span>print; it's the final track on the regular edition of the album), <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/3tnEfYn4GYBVf6oUIZzSs3?si=a75f7e5179fe44ae" target="_blank">"Pills N Potions,"</a> <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/3PrG4JHWo8aBgSOLiqCw9T?si=4d352db5ec1d47f4" target="_blank">"All Things Go"</a> and <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/2poTrSpWRQnr3XPmD5Gj50?si=b2e393a4b7bd4b27" target="_blank">"I Lied"</a> (another emotional song), Nicki showed that she's not just another sexual rapper, and that she uses her music to express her feelings like a true artist.</li>
      <li>In addition, the song <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/4KpAlKo4zqnfXqhVW0QxPO?si=412db98a404647cb" target="_blank">"Feeling Myself"</a> featuring Beyonc√© shows Nicki and Bey showing off their musical accomplishments and their elite status in the music industry. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/5pekaGq0N6VkDiTZJgK18A?si=1f9a67a87b4b4206" target="_blank">"Only"</a> features Drake and Chris Brown, where Nicki denies having relationships with certain rappers in the industry. All in all, the album shows off a raw form of Nicki where she unapologetically raps/sings about what she feels, whether she's confident, sad, unsure or angry. The album is a mix of sadness and confidenc, and if I were to describe it in one word, it would be "raw."</li>

    <h2>Queen</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Queen is Nicki's fourth studio album, and it was released on August 10<sup>th</sup>, 2018. It is her first studio album in almost 4 years, the last one being the<span class="pink-friday">Pink</span>print. It was promoted on Queen Radio on Apple Music, where she "tells it like it is." While many people don't like Queen as much as her other albums, it is considered as an iconic comback by the Barbz, and many of the songs are praised and love, showing off Nicki's talent and parts of herself from past eras.</li>
      <li>This is shown in songs like <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/28eiD8ukLWhTvoDm1ZFPK0?si=bf5a49475e5e4218" target="_blank">"Barbie Dreams,"</a> which is based on one of the songs from one of her mixtapes when she first started out, and she uses many funny lines when dissing the rappers (which is done all in good fun, as many of the rappers she disses are her colleagues and friends).</li>
      <li>In addition, Nicki Minaj's <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/7I9svbEdAvJrXNdruNhad4?si=333bc00369104c2d" target="_blank">"Chun-Li"</a> features her alter ego of the same name, which she created based on the video game character of the same name, which is almost like a metaphor, as Chun-Li is the first prominent female fighting game character and Nicki is considered to have revitalized female rap. This is because many rappers before her are not as active as she is now, such as Lil Kim and Queen Latifa. Creating alter egos is also something that Nicki is known for, and it is her way of applying what she learned about acting at LaGuardia to her music.</li>
      <li>Many of the songs on this albums are her asserting her dominance and showing that she is the MVP of the rap game, and reminding everyone of her status as the Queen of Rap. Examples of such songs are <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/7I9svbEdAvJrXNdruNhad4?si=333bc00369104c2d" target="_blank">"Chun-Li"</a> and <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/0mlJoKzEY0kyTXwSr7k3H7?si=8b4b30212ca1406b" target="_blank">"LLC."</a> The song also features more sassy songs that portary Nicki as what I call a "baddie," such as "Good Form," which has <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/5AHu27TVFUg0ANQUrFDMr0?si=812e6a77bf24439b" target="_blank">a version with only Nicki</a> and <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/6supMAknraGpJrN5qqYfV8?si=6627edf692bc47d9" target="_blank">another version that features Lil Wayne</a>, and <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/4Hh5bo6KQF0Ys0ZLQu5lTz?si=44d6d475cff34e2d" target="_blank">"Chun Swae,"</a> which features Swae Lee. This album all in all shows the confident Nicki that everyone is familiar with, and she is making sure that everyone knows that she won't retire her crown anytime soon.</li>
